# Chess Burger 🍔♟️

Welcome to **Chess Burger** — a simple little chess program written in Java!  
The name? It just sounded fun, like "cheese burger".

Special thanks to **Sikongdddl** for providing the initial codebase that made this project possible! 🙏

## Features
- Basic chess rules implementation
- Simple GUI built with Swing
- Local multiplayer support (play with a friend)

## How to Run
This project was originally created using IntelliJ IDEA, but the code is simple enough that you can also run it straight from the command line!

Here's how:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zchi2002/Chess-Burger.git
cd Chess-Burger/src/main/java
javac -encoding UTF-8 *.java
java Main
```
